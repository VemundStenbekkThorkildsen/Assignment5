Folder containing the python scripts generating the different plots. The different script plots for different cases:
* __2Danal.py__
  - plots the 2 dimensional analytical solution for the explicit scheme
* __analyticplot.py__
  - plots the analytical solutions for the three-layer model for Earth's lithosphere
* __geoplot.py__
  - plots the numerical solutions for the three-layer model for Earth's lithosphere
* __plotter.py__
  - plots the solutions for both the analytical solution and numerical solution for the one dimensional model
* __plotter2d.py__
  - plots the numerical solutions for the 2 dimensional explicit scheme
